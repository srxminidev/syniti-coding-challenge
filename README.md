**What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.**  
In Sonar Software, I got opportunity to reduce cost of hosting services on AWS. I participated in designing the infrastructure to host the application and keeping the cost optimal and on the same time we maintained the upbringing the customer engagement.

**What's a personal project you're currently working on? This could be a coding side project, hobby, or otherwise real world project you're working on.**
Ans: I recently worked on a project for auto refinancing company where I designed / restructured the form and visuals using Next JS. The earlier version of form and architecture was monolith where a minimum change requires to go through the entire projects to see what is breaking and what is not breaking.I broke down the project architecture in different modules and each modules got deployed separately. So basically I converted them in micro-ui where each team can work dependently and make the product more robust.

**Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should read it.**
I consider myself as a bookworm so when it comes to describing a book I read, I am really confused since I don’t know which one to choose but I will tell you about the book I have just finished most recently. It is about mastering AWS.I read this books because I wanted to up skill myself and wanted to fill the gap of cloud computing by brushing it up with correct information.

**Tell us about one of your favourite products (physical or software) and one specific aspect that makes it truly great.**
My favourite product is Instagram.
"Before I explain why it’s my favourite app, I’ll quickly review how Instagram works.
Instagram has two main types of users: end users and advertisers.
End users choose accounts to follow (e.g. friends and family, influencers, brands, etc.), which in turn creates a personalised feed of photos and videos that provides information, entertainment, and inspiration.
These users can also upload photos and videos to share with their own followers.
Advertisers sell products and build their brand on the platform.

They can do this by paying for ads that show up as recommended posts and stories, by building an engaging account that people want to follow, or a combination of the two."

“The more time users are on the app and the deeper their engagement, the more rewarding the platform is to advertisers, which creates a virtuous cycle. Therefore, in terms of its business objectives, Instagram is most likely interested in user engagement and revenue.”# syniti-coding-challenge
